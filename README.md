## Introduction

This course will cover the very basics of TypeScript. We make an assumption that you have a general understanding of either JavaScript or another programming language. This course will not teach you JavaScript or the fundamentals of programming so if you haven't programmed before, be sure to set aside extra time so you can explore concepts and skills that may be foreign to you. If know another language like Java, Python, or C#, this course will cover many programming constructs already very familiar to you (like classes and inheritance) but will show you how to implement them in TypeScript. If you know JavaScript well, many of the concepts in TypeScript will be familar but we'll cover some concepts that may be new to you and show you how TypeScript can enhance your JavaScript programming.
